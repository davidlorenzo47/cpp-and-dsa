A Counter is a dict subclass for counting hashable objects. 
It is a collection where elements are stored as dictionary keys and their counts are stored as dictionary values. 
Counts are allowed to be any integer value including zero or negative counts. 
The Counter class is similar to bags or multisets in other languages.
Eg:
Code:
    from collections import Counter
    s = "fdgbbgfngsfdr"
    Counter(s)
Output: 
    Counter({'f': 3, 'g': 3, 'd': 2, 'b': 2, 'n': 1, 's': 1, 'r': 1})

List:
To create an empty list: 
    a = []
To create a list with 10 elements, filled with 1:
    a = [1]*10
To sort a list:
    a.sort()

Set:
    A set has unique elements.
    If we transfer all the elements of a list to a set, set will have unique elements and thus set will remove duplicate entries.
