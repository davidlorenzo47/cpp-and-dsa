Algorithm Inorder(tree):
1. Traverse the left subtree, i.e., call Inorder(left->subtree)
2. Visit the root.
3. Traverse the right subtree, i.e., call Inorder(right->subtree)

Algorithm Preorder(tree):
1. Visit the root.
2. Traverse the left subtree, i.e., call Preorder(left->subtree)
3. Traverse the right subtree, i.e., call Preorder(right->subtree)

Algorithm Postorder(tree):
1. Traverse the left subtree, i.e., call Postorder(left->subtree)
2. Traverse the right subtree, i.e., call Postorder(right->subtree)
3. Visit the root

There are three ways to read a binary tree:
1. Prefix: Root node, then left child, then right child
2. Infix: Left child, then root node, then right child
3. Postfix: Left child, then right child, then root node

Properties of Binary Tree:
1. The minimum total number of nodes with height h: h+1
2. The maximum total number of nodes with height h: 2^(h+1) -1
