preorder: parent => left => right
inorder: left => parent => right
postorder: left => right => parent

Hint to Remember: 
  IN means root is in middle: inorder: left => root => right 
  PRE means root is at front: preorder: root => left => right
  POST means root is at the end: postorder: left => right => root
Always left comes first than right

There are three ways to read a binary tree:
1. Prefix: Root node, then left child, then right child
2. Infix: Left child, then root node, then right child
3. Postfix: Left child, then right child, then root node

Properties of Binary Tree:
1. The minimum total number of nodes with height h: h+1
2. The maximum total number of nodes with height h (the height of the root is considered as 1): 2^h -1
3. In Binary tree where every node has 0 or 2 children, the number of leaf nodes is always one more than nodes with two children.
4. In a non empty binary tree, if n is the total number of nodes and e is the total number of edges, then e = n-1
